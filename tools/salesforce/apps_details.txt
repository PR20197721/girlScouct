Setup -> Build -> Create -> Manage Custom Apps -> Connected Apps

Connected Apps are used for sso and oauth (3rd party connection to SF)
SSO composed of SSO app and oauth app
Login with sso -> returns access token.
Maintain connection with oauth -> recognizes token

Callback URL -> page that expects an access token after login.

We don’t use refresh tokens. SSO handles the refresh.
We use full oauth permissions when creating apps

Consumer Key and Consumer Secret needed to communicate with app. Stored in configuration:
/apps/girlscouts-vtk/config.{env}.publish/org.girlscouts.vtk.impl.helpers.ConfigManagerImpl.config
*Changing this file can turn off publish momentarily. Don’t do it on prod unless it’s important, and have Elham supervise.*

clientid is consumer key
clientsecret is consumer secret
Oauth is the same app for all SF uat. SSO varies for all our environments.
SSOCertificate is created in command line (openssl?) and uploaded to app
targetUrl is landing page after callbackurl
baseUrl is for our use. We use it to dynamically generate urls
gsNewYear used in code for new GS year
gsCertificate is downloaded from their app to ours – on sso handshake, is used to generate request
councilMapping is for council codes
callbackUrl -> same as in app
idpSsoTargetUrl part of the handshake, comes from app -> manage -> for communities -> idp-initiated login url
vtkApi fields point to salesforce services used to get database info

SalesforceDO.java should help us figure out the salesforce services

Before we can use an app, we need to give it a profile
Profiles are permissions we add to apps. We can not add profiles ourselves. John Adams does this. We ask him to add the profile to the connected app.
