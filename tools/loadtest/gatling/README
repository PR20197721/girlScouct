this is a load test written using the Gatling framework.  In addition to running tests, Gatling can also act as a recording proxy so you can easily record yourself as you browse to quickly make new tests.

To learn more about Gatling:
    http://gatling.io/docs/2.1.7/quickstart.html#quickstart

To run the test:
    mvn compile
    mvn gatling:execute

To create tests you will need to download the Gatling bundle from the zip site and expand it in your GATLING_HOME directory (could be anywhere).

You will need Java 8 to run the recorder inside $GATLING_HOME/bin/recorder.sh.
Change the proxy listening port to an open port (default 8000) and update your browser's network configuration to use the proxy to access the internet.

e.g. Manual proxy configuration:
	HTTP Proxy: localhost Port:8000

If running the recorder on localhost, be sure to remove the proxy exclusion for localhost.

Click Start! on the Gatling recorder and click around on your browser to create your test.
When finished, the script will be saved in the $GATLING_HOME/user-files/simulations/ directory.
