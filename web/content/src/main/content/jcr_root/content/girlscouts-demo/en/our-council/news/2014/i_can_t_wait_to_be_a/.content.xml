                    text="&lt;p>When a girl says, “I can’t wait to,” you know that what’s coming next is something she’s excited about. Whether she’s talking about tomorrow’s trip to the art museum or football game next Saturday, that wide-eyed anticipation is one of the best parts of childhood. Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council (GSSJC), one of the largest Girl Scout councils in the U.S., is giving girls the opportunity to make memories that last a lifetime by being a part of the premier leadership organization for girls. It’s kicking off recruitment season with rallies across southeast Texas.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>During this time, girls in kindergarten through seniors in high school can register to join and learn the benefits of Girl Scouts. Through programs that include science and technology, business and economic literacy, visual arts as well as outdoor and environmental awareness, Girl Scouts discover themselves, connect with others and take action to make the world a better place.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>“Girls are succeeding in many areas today – in the classroom and on the playing field,” said Mary Vitek, GSSJC CEO.&amp;nbsp; “Yet 61 percent of girls are deeply ambivalent about leadership.&amp;nbsp;Girl Scouts helps girls develop their leadership skills and have the confidence to take on the leadership roles of the future in all aspects of society in a fun and safe environment.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Earlier this year, Girl Scouts of the USA conducted a survey of more than 3,000 parents of registered Girl Scouts about their experience. Ninety-seven percent of those parents said Girl Scouts has been a positive activity for their daughter and 94 percent said that Girl Scouts makes their daughter feel special and important. Girl Scouts offers girls new experiences and opportunities and parents are well aware of this. In addition, the poll revealed that 96 percent of girls have tried at least one new thing as a Girl Scout.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>“Girl Scouts is for every girl, everywhere and teaches girls that no challenge is too big,” said Vitek. “While membership dues are only $15 a year, the rewards girls, their families and their communities reap are invaluable.”&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Girl Scouts is not just for girls, it’s also for adults − caring individuals willing to share their time and talents to help girls explore their interests and achieve their potential. According to the survey, nearly two-thirds of Girl Scout volunteers believe that their volunteer experience has helped them professionally and 92 percent of Girl Scout volunteers feel that Girl Scouts helps them learn or share something new.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>For more information about GSSJC membership or to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gssjc.org/membership/mrally/index.cfm&quot;>find a rally near you&lt;/a>, call 713-292-0300 or 1-800-392-4340 or visit www.girlscouts.org.
