To Install:

Build and deploy bundle to VTK publish instances. e.g.:
mvn clean install
curl -u admin:admin -F action=install -F bundlestartlevel=20 -F bundlefile=@"./target/girlscouts-vtk-replication-bundle-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" http://localhost:4505/system/console/bundles
This will deploy a custom receiver on the publish instance.

On the two VTK publish instances, use CRXDE to copy and rename an existing publish agent:
/etc/replication/agents.author/publish --> /etc/replication/agents.publish/vtk-publish

Go to the replication agent (e.g. http://localhost:4505/etc/replication/agents.publish/vtk-publish.html) and edit name and description.
In the trasport tab, modify URI to point to a target VTK node custom receiver (e.g. http://localhost:4506/bin/vtk-receive?sling:authRequestLogin=1)
Update credentials and save.
Go to the Triggers tab and click "Ignore Default"  This will prevent normal replication behavior.
Click Test Connection to validate.
You will need to repeat these step on other publish VTK instance.
