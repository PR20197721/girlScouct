What would sunrise/breakfast time look like? Or sunset/dinnertime? Which way would you be facing? Make a prediction (guess) just like a scientist.

REMEMBER: Do not look directly at the Sun. To do that, we'd need special tools called filters that protect our eyes.</i></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take the girls outside and have them draw what they see.

										"<p><b>Note to Volunteers:</b></p>\n<p>The excitement of running troop meetings for the first time can sometimes be overwhelming. For that reason, scripting is included to help. These &quot;lines&quot; are under the heading &quot;<b>SAY</b>;&quot; however, you're the expert. If you feel you don't need the script, do what makes sense for you and your girls.</p>\n<p>Your girls may ask you things that you don't know--that's ok! Tell them that asking questions is part of being a good scientist. Brainstorm ways you can work together to find the answers. It's also possible that no one knows yet--maybe your girls will grow up to discover them!</p>\n<p><b>Three Steps/Two Choices per Step</b></p>\n<p>Each Daisy must complete three steps in order to earn her Space Science Explorer badge. Each step has 2 activity choices. We suggest that you choose the first activity, and ask your girls to help decide the rest.</p>\n<p><b>Prepare Ahead</b></p>\n<p><b>General:&nbsp;</b>Talk to anyone helping you about what they will do at this meeting.</p>\n<p><b>General:&nbsp;</b>Review&nbsp;<b>Women in Space Science</b>&nbsp;to familiarize yourself with resources that can help your girls learn more about women's roles in STEM fields.</p>\n<p><b>Opening Ceremony:</b>&nbsp;If you or your girls need it, print out copies of the&nbsp;<b><a href=\"https://my.girlscouts.org/content/dam/girlscouts-vtk/global/aid/The-Girl-Scout-Promise-and-Law.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" adhocenable=\"false\">Girl Scout Promise and Law</a></b>.</p>\n<p><b>Explore the Sun:</b>&nbsp;The resource,&nbsp;<a href=\"/content/dam/girlscouts-vtk/global/aid/NASA/The-Sun.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" adhocenable=\"false\"><b>The Sun</b></a>, was developed especially for volunteers. Familiarize yourself with the facts and definitions to help you lead your girls through the activities in this badge.</p>\n<p><b>Make a Day Sky Book:&nbsp;</b>If it's easier for you, create and bind the girls' day sky books before the meeting. You can punch holes and tie the pages together with string or staple them--whatever works best.</p>\n<p><b>Make a Shadow Poster:&nbsp;</b>This activity works best on a clear day when the Sun is in the sky. If the weather keeps you from going outside, consider choosing a different activity.</p>\n<p><b>Make a Shadow Poster:&nbsp;</b>Cut sheets of butcher paper (taller than each girl) for all of your troop members, OR use smaller pieces of paper (enough for each girl).</p>\n<p><b>Activity Choice Descriptions:&nbsp;</b>Review the&nbsp;<b><a href=\"/content/dam/girlscouts-vtk/global/aid/NASA/Daisy-Mtg-1-Activity-Choice-Descriptions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" adhocenable=\"false\">Activity Choice Descriptions</a></b>&nbsp;ahead of time.

Just like a space scientist, girls will explore and observe the Sun, Moon and stars as they look at the sky and talk about what they see!</p>\n<p>Steps:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explore the Sun</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observe the Moon</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet the Stars</p>\n<p>In this session, girls begin activities toward earning the Space Science Explorer badge.</p>\n<p>They will earn their badge after completing activities at the end of the second Space Science Explorer meeting.</p>\n<p><b>Meeting Length</b></p>\n<p>60 minutes</p>\n<p>The times given for each activity will vary, depending on how many girls are in the troop.</p>\n<p>Plus, girls may really enjoy a particular activity and want to continue past the suggested time. As much as possible, let them! That's part of keeping Girl Scouting girl-led!</p>\n"
