<p><b>Time Allotment</b></p> 
<p>20 minutes</p> 
<p><b>Materials</b></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Art supplies <i>&mdash;</i> paper, cardboard boxes, markers, crayons, colored pencils, glue, glitter glue, etc. Use whatever you have at hand or is easy to get! Bring something to cover the table with so it doesn't get dirty, and supplies with which to clean up (wipes, papers towels, etc.). </li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Steps</b></p> 
<p>Have girls start planning what type of Team Passport they want to create to capture the story of what they do together on this Journey. </p> 
<p><b>SAY: </b></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><i>We're going to create a Team Passport. A passport is a little booklet that lets you go places around the world. And each time you go to a new place, you get your passport stamped with the name of the place you visited. So, with those stamps in it, a passport tells the story of your travels. </i></li> 
 <li><i>Today we're going to start our Team Passport. It's going to tell the story of this Girl Scout Journey we're taking together and we're going to add to it at each meeting.</i></li> 
 <li><i>Let your imaginations run wild!</i></li> 
 <li><i>Let</i>'s <i>talk about a few ways you can create a Team Passport:</i></li> 
 <li><i>You could decorate a box with maps or postcards and fill it with items you've made or chosen that reflect what you did on this Journey.</i></li> 
 <li><i>You could make a photo album or photo display. At each meeting, different girls would take turns being the group photographer and then you can post photos from the previous meeting and write captions for them.</i></li> 
 <li><i>You could create a diorama and design the background for it, and then add toy figures, cutouts, or other items each time we get together.</i></li> 
 <li><i>Or how about making a mural? Each time we meet, you could decorate pieces of paper with stickers, rubber stampings, drawings, writing, pictures, photos &mdash; or whatever you choose. The panels could be taped together as the Journey progresses, so that you can see your story taking shape.</i></li> 
 <li>Once decided, let girls start creating their Team Passport for a few minutes.</li> 
</ul>
