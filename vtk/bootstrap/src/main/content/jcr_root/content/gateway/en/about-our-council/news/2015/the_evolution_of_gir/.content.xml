Selma Rutledge recalls her grandmother making the cookies she sold in a small paper bag with a ribbon round it. While the Girl Scout Cookie program has evolved since then, the benefits are still just as amazing! According to Selma, “selling cookies taught me how to meet people and how to present myself. It gave me the courage to stand up and speak up.”"
