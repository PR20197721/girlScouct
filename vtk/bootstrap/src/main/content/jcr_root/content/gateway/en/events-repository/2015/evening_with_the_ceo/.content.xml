The Forums have enriched the intellectual and cultural life of Jacksonville for over two decades, while contributing more than $6 million to Wolfson Children’s Hospital. This year’s series is presented by&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcbsfl.com/&quot;>Florida Blue&lt;/a>&lt;/b>,&lt;b>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.landstar.com/&quot;>Landstar System, Inc.&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wellsfargo.com/&quot;>Wells Fargo&lt;/a>&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Few individuals have the breadth of political, economic and military leadership experience as former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. The most decorated soldier in Israeli history, Barak most recently served as the Israeli Minister of Defense. Recognized for his far-reaching and positive impact on Israel’s security and economic prosperity and a major player in Middle Eastern peace efforts, Barak will offer a frank and honest view of global politics, world economics and the state of Israel.&lt;/p>&#xa;"
