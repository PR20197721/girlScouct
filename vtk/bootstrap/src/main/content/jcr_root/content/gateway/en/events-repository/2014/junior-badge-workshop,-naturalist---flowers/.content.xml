In spring time we can see and smell these beautiful blooms, and now it is time to take a closer look at flowers. Our juniors will dissect a flower and examine it under a microscope, all while learning how important they are to people. Through hands on activities girls will be having an adventure and discovering new facts about flowers. This event costs $12 per girl."
