On Saturday night, girls will elect an Event Director and work in committees to plan an event for younger Girl Scouts. On Sunday, girls will be using their newly acquired leadership skills and event expertise to host a Daisy Fun Day or a Brownie Play Day. Note: In order for girls to participate and be certified for the Program Aide training, girls must attend the entire weekend. If you believe a girl cannot attend the complete weekend from Friday to Sunday, we kindly ask you to reschedule for a weekend when she can.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>** All attendees must be registered Girl Scouts for the 2016 Membership Year.&amp;nbsp; All adults must be registered &amp;amp; approved volunteers.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Last day to Register online or receive a refund - October 30, 2015&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;"
