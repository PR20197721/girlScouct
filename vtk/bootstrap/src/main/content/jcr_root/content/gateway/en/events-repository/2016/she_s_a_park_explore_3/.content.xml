Fun patch provided. Park entrance fee included.&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;br>&#xa;*This event is for 2016 registered Girl Scouts, and registered &amp;amp; approved adult volunteers.&lt;br>&#xa;* For safety and supervision reasons, troops and individuals are not permitted to bring non-Girl Scouts or siblings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xa;*Girl/adult ratios must be followed and adults are expected to stay on the premises during the event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;br>&#xa;$8/girl, $8/adult&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xa;Contact: Brittany McCallister 904.389.3071&lt;/p>&#xa;"
