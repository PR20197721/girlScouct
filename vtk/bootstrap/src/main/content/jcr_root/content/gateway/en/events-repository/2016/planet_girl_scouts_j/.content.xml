We just found out Mars will be close to Earth in May 2016, giving us a chance to see one of its polar cap ice, dark markings, and maybe even clouds on a world merely 47 million miles away! Yes, our telescopes are that good! Girl Scouts will also learn about the other 'classic planets' and how our solar system formed around our star, as well as the relative size of the planets and solar system – Pluto included! If the Moon sets early enough we may be able to tell constellation stories! Are you a trained astronomy PA? Then, this event is for you, too! PAs will be able to increase their astronomical knowledge and have some fun helping younger Girl Scouts discover the mysteries of Planet Girl Scouts! Fun patch included.&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;br>&#xa;*This event is for PA’s and Girl Scouts. Please select which level you are during registration.&lt;br>&#xa;*For safety and supervision reasons, troops and individuals are not permitted to bring non-Girl Scouts or siblings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xa;*Girl/adult ratios must be followed and adults are expected to stay on the premises during the event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xa;*Telescopic viewing of the planets is weather permitting.&lt;br>&#xa;*Planet Girl Scouts can get windy and cool so make sure to dress in layers so you are comfortable!&lt;br>&#xa;*We encourage adults to participate in the fun of Planet Girl Scouts with us!&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;br>&#xa;$7/girl, $7/adult, no fee for PAs&lt;br>&#xa;Contact: Brittany McCallister 904.389.3071&lt;/p>&#xa;"
