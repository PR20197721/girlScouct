We are dedicated to safeguarding any personally identifiable information collected online and to helping parents and children have positive experiences on the Internet. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xa;We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. With parental consent, we may collect information from children under the age of 13 such as: name, address, email address, account information, and user generated content. This information allows us to fulfill a requested transaction and facilitate participation in online programs, keep records, undertake certain marketing activities, or to otherwise customize or enhance the Web site experience for children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Children under the age of 13 may be able to make certain content such as user generated content visible to others or the public. This could include, for example, a webpage or parts of webpages operated by children that have been designed for group or public viewing. However, absent parental consent, children under 13 would be allowed to display only limited information such as a first name or unique user name or other information that does not allow for online contacting by third parties.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Regardless of what information is displayed, parents can revoke their consent and ask that information about their children be deleted from the site by contacting our offices by phone at (904) 388-4653 or via email at councilcontact@girlscouts-gateway.org.&amp;nbsp; To do this or to review personally identifiable information collected from children, we must verify the identity of the requesting parent. When a parent revokes consent, we will stop collecting, using, or disclosing information from that child. To respect the privacy of parents, information collected and used for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing notice is not maintained in retrievable form by the site if parental consent is not obtained after a reasonable time.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Submissions&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Girl Scouts of Gateway Council welcomes children to learn more about our organization and, where appropriate, participate in polls and surveys, as well as submit comments, artwork, writings, and other submissions for posting on our Web site. For this reason, Girl Scouts of Gateway Council follows the guidelines for interactive electronic media published by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Better Business Bureau for pages targeted to children under 13. However, we encourage this be done only with their parent's knowledge and supervision. We also encourage children to use an alias (e.g., &amp;quot;Bookworm&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Skater&amp;quot;, etc.), first name, nickname, initials, or other alternative to full names or screen names which correspond with an e-mail address for any activities which will involve public posting.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>In keeping with CARU's Principle regarding respecting and fostering the parents' role in providing guidance for their children, we encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of e-mail and other online activities regularly.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Visitors should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by the Girl Scouts of Gateway Council Web site through the use of &amp;quot;cookies&amp;quot; or other similar technologies such as web beacons. &amp;quot;Cookies&amp;quot; are small text files a Web site can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor's ongoing access to and use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements. Cookies are not programs that come onto a visitor's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no meaning outside the assigning site. If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. “Web beacons” are a small snippet of code embedded in webpages typically used to monitor activity on a webpage and transfer or collect information, such as information about your Internet Protocol address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the browser type that is accessing the site, and the ID number of cookies placed on your computer.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Girl Scouts of Gateway Council uses &amp;quot;cookie&amp;quot; technology only to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors in order to improve visitors' online experience and facilitate their visit within our site.
