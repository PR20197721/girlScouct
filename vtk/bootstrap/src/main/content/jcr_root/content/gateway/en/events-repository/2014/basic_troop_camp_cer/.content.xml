Anyone in the troop/group can be the camp-trained volunteer. When you sign up for Session II and III, you must be able to attend both of these sessions together, as the in-town is the planning session for the camp session.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>In order to be certified for this course, participants must complete all three of the stages:&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>Basic Troop Camp Certification Session I (Online): The online portion will review:&amp;nbsp; Planning with your girls, Kaper Charts, Progression, Outdoor Skills, and more!&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>Basic Troop Camp Certification Session II (In-town): This class will be an opportunity to get together a team and work with other volunteers and plan your meals for the camp session.&amp;nbsp; This is the in-town session that prepares you for Session III.&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>Basic Troop Camp Certification Session III (Overnight):&amp;nbsp; Utilize the planning that you and your patrol developed during your in-town training session at camp.&amp;nbsp; In the final step of this process, volunteers attend camp to participate and demonstrate the skills that they have learned under the careful instruction of a facilitator.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This session has been developed to meet the needs of all of our volunteers.&amp;nbsp; If you are a hearty camper who has slept in the out-of-doors in a cabin or tent, you will only need to attend this class for the day on Saturday. For those volunteers who have never camped or are uncomfortable with the out-of-doors, you will begin your at-camp session on Friday evening and experience the adventure of sleeping in the out-of-doors.&amp;nbsp; Discussion with your facilitator during the in-town camp portion will decide which opportunity is best for you.&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Last day to register online is October 27, 2014&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;"
